Can AI learn to be curious?

In this repo, we want to understand
1. Can model identify the user knows something new that they don't?
2. Can model proactively ask clarifying questions to learn new knowledge
3. Can model update its knowledge base to incorporate new knowledge
4. Can model cross validate with its existing knowledge?

Here we don't study adversarial attacks. The user also provides truth.
